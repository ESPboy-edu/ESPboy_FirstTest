# Try "First test" to check your ESPboy after assembling
www.espboy.com project

There are 3 versions:

1. ESPboy_FristTest_AdafruitLibs - does not use custom ESPboy libs and uses only standard [Adafruit libraries (slow and poor, but simple)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library) to control ESPboy hardware (LED, buttons, sound, display)

2. ESPboy_FirstTest_ESPboyLibs_TFTeSPI -- *uses ESPboy libs* and [TFT_eSPI (fastest)](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI?ysclid=ln67tav62z348840877) graphics library for display (be carefull, to force it work properly with ESPboy's display you have to edit parameters in "User_Setup.h" file in TFT_eSPI library folder according [to this](https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_ArduinoIDE_Libraries/blob/master/TFT_eSPI-master/User_Setup.h) )

3. ESPboy_FirstTest_ESPboyLibs_LovyanGFX -- *uses ESPboy libs* and [LovyanGFX (most advanced)](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX) graphics library for display

4. ESPboy_ArdublockFirstTest -- uses [Ardublock.ru v3](http://ardublock.ru/3/)

# To start work with ESPboy

1. Install Arduino IDE legacy 1.8.n recommended (not v2.n IDE) https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. Install the WeMos D1 mini ESP866 board to your Arduino IDE https://www.instructables.com/Wemos-ESP8266-Getting-Started-Guide-Wemos-101/

3. Install all the libs for ESPboy from here https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_ArduinoIDE_Libraries

4. Select the "LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini" board in the Arduino IDE and compile this code

5. Test ESPboy hardware:
- Power on
- 8 buttons
- Display TFT and its backlit
- RGB led
- Buzzer/Speaker

6. For better experience you have to istall to your Arduino IDE ["Little FS file uploader plugin"](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin) and ["ESP exception decoder plugin"](https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder)

7. If you want to have professinal development tool much more powerfull than standard Arduino IDE, learn ["VS Code" + "PlatformIO"](https://circuitsgeek.com/guides-and-how-to/programming-esp8266-using-vs-code-and-platformio/)

8. [Use recommended Arduino IDE settings](https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_FirstTest/blob/master/settings.png)

![Arduino IDE settings](settings.png)



# Try "First test" to start programming

1. Use this example to start coding with ESPboy

2. To init ESPboy hardware use begin() of [ESPboy_Init class](https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_Classes)

3. For doing graphics use methods of [TFT_eSPI class](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) or [adafruit ST7735 lib](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library) or [LovyanGFX lib](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX) according to your GFX-way choice

4. For buttons use getkeys() of ESPboyInit and keypressed&PAD_LEFT, keypressed&PAD_RIGHT and so on to understand what key is exactly pressed

5. For LED use ESPboy_LED class https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_Classes or NeoPixel https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

6. For sound use playTone(frequency, duration), playTone (frequency) and noPlayTone() methods of ESPboy_Init class https://github.com/ESPboy-edu/ESPboy_Classes 

7. To control the LCD backlit use Adafruit MCP4725 library methods https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MCP4725 (not supported in ESPboy easy DIY versions)

8. To upload data (files) to internal flash file system use Arduino IDE plugins: 

a) [Little FS](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin)

b) [SPIFFS](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin)

9. To upload to ESPboy already compiled ".bin" files, use [Flash Download Tools](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/Guide-How-To-Upload-bin-to-ESP8266-ESP32)

10. You can try [alternate ESPboy lib, made by Steph](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/espboy/) and [instructions](https://m1cr0lab-espboy.github.io/ESPboy)

11. Use ESP8266 Arduino Core documentation https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

12. Use [WebAppStore](https://espboy.m1cr0lab.com/demo/appstore/) and WiFiAppStore directly from the device (first install "AppStore2 (OTA2)" from the WebAppStore)

13. Ask questions in [ESPboy forum](https://community.arduboy.com) and ESPboy [discord chat](https://discord.gg/kMWhY2x)

14. Have FUN! :)

Roman
